When file is being read for internal Sourcegraph needs and when it's passed to 
toolchain for indexing different ways of extracting file content are used.

In the first case, file is retrieved using `git show COMMIT:NAME` command 
from Git blob.
In the second case, file is checked from the remote repository and optionally 
transformed using `.gitattributes` rules.
File data received in both cases should be consistent, otherwise spans generated
by toolchains and spans generated by syntax highlight module may overlap causing
incorrect visual representation. In order to be consistent with the results of `git show COMMIT:NAME` `.gitattributes` should be tweaked at checkout to disable any feature that may change content.

This repository demonstrates possible issues when there is a `.gitattributes`
file which may contain attributes affecting source code such as
* `eol=crlf` When present, checked out source file will have CRLF line endings 
but `git show COMMIT:NAME` will have LF ones.
* `ident` When present, `$Id$` entries in the source code will be replaced 
with `$Id:`, followed by the 40-character hexadecimal blob object name, f
ollowed by a dollar sign.
* `filter=NAME` When present, source code may be transformed by specific filter
